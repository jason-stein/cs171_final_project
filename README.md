# Harvard Univsersity CS171 - Visualization Final Project
#### Contributors: Andrew Lund, Robert Roessler, Jason Stein

### In accordance with the final project submission guidelines, this .zip file contains the following:
- **index.html** is the final website implementation and found in the top-level directory. The user-interface is self-explanatory, and we highly encourage first time users to select the "Guide Me" button on the homepage for an overview of our data wrangling, storytelling, and dashboard exploration instructions.
- **Code:** all website-related files are found in the css, data, fonts, img, and js folders. JS files for visualization implementations are: bubbleChart.js, dashboard.js, departmentTimeline.js, enrollmentBarchart.js, gantt.js, main.js, MartiniStoryOne_AreaChart.js, MartiniStoryTwo_StackedAreaChart.js, and stackedAreaChart.js.
- **Data:** The data used in the implementation of our site is found in the data folder. Data wrangling scripts are found in the python folder. Please be aware that this data is sensitive and proprietary and is not to be shared outside of this class. For more information regarding the data, please contact one of the students or the metaLAB directly.
- **Process Book:** in PDF format in the top-level directory.
- **Website Link:** Since the data used for the implementation is sensitive and proprietary to Harvard University (metaLAB and the Registrar's Office), we have not hosted our website on a public server. This deviation from overall project guidelines was arranged with Johanna and Michael on 30 November 2017.
